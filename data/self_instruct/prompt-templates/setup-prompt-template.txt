You are tasked with creating the setup for a novel task for benchmarking terminal-based AI agents.  
The task must follow the format and structure of existing tasks in terminal-bench.

Each task in terminal-bench resides in its own directory and includes several key files:
- instruction.md: Clear, self-contained task description that an AI agent will read
- task.toml: Metadata (category, difficulty, author, tags)
- task-deps/: Directory containing any auxiliary files needed and described in the instruction.md

--- EXAMPLE TASK ---
```json
{EXAMPLE}
```


Here is the task name and a description I have in mind:
TASK NAME: {TASK_NAME}
DESCRIPTION: {DESCRIPTION}

You should design a novel, challenging task and place it in a directory named after the task.

While creating the task please ensure the following 4 requirements (VERY IMPORTANT):
- There should be a valid solution script that can solve the task in a Docker container
- Tasks can verified without using any external resources such as starting up a VM, hosting an endpoint, etc
- Instructions are clear enough for an AI agent to understand
- Task difficulty matches the complexity rating
